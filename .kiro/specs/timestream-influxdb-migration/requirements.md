# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for migrating the ONS data platform from Amazon Timestream to Amazon Timestream for InfluxDB. This migration addresses the AWS service access limitations encountered with regular Timestream while maintaining all time series functionality and improving compatibility with existing InfluxDB tooling and queries. The solution will provide the same high-performance time series data storage and querying capabilities while leveraging InfluxDB's mature ecosystem and query language.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to replace Amazon Timestream with Timestream for InfluxDB, so that we can overcome AWS service access restrictions while maintaining time series functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL use Amazon Timestream for InfluxDB instead of regular Amazon Timestream
2. WHEN data is ingested THEN the system SHALL store time series data in InfluxDB format with proper retention policies
3. WHEN existing queries are executed THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility for all current time series operations
4. IF AWS access issues occur THEN the system SHALL have better service availability compared to regular Timestream
5. WHEN the service is provisioned THEN it SHALL be accessible without requiring special AWS service access approvals

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want to migrate existing time series data structures to InfluxDB format, so that all historical data remains accessible and queryable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data migration starts THEN the system SHALL convert existing Parquet time series data to InfluxDB line protocol format
2. WHEN data is converted THEN the system SHALL preserve all timestamps, measurements, tags, and field values
3. WHEN migration is complete THEN the system SHALL validate data integrity between source and destination
4. IF data conversion fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed errors and continue with remaining data
5. WHEN historical data is queried THEN the system SHALL return results identical to the original Timestream implementation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to update Lambda functions to use InfluxDB client libraries, so that data ingestion continues to work seamlessly with the new database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Lambda functions are updated THEN they SHALL use the InfluxDB Python client instead of Timestream client
2. WHEN data is written THEN the system SHALL use InfluxDB line protocol for optimal performance
3. WHEN batch writes occur THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling and retry logic
4. IF write operations fail THEN the system SHALL queue data for retry with exponential backoff
5. WHEN data is ingested THEN the system SHALL maintain the same throughput performance as the original implementation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an analyst, I want to query time series data using InfluxQL or Flux queries, so that I can leverage InfluxDB's powerful query capabilities for energy data analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN queries are executed THEN the system SHALL support both InfluxQL and Flux query languages
2. WHEN complex time series aggregations are needed THEN the system SHALL provide window functions, grouping, and mathematical operations
3. WHEN API queries are made THEN the system SHALL translate natural language questions to appropriate InfluxDB queries
4. IF query performance is slow THEN the system SHALL implement proper indexing and retention policies
5. WHEN results are returned THEN the system SHALL format data consistently with existing API response schemas

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to provision Timestream for InfluxDB using Terraform, so that infrastructure deployment remains automated and version-controlled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Terraform is applied THEN the system SHALL create a Timestream for InfluxDB cluster with appropriate configuration
2. WHEN the cluster is provisioned THEN it SHALL include proper VPC networking, security groups, and IAM roles
3. WHEN scaling is needed THEN the system SHALL support automatic scaling based on workload demands
4. IF provisioning fails THEN Terraform SHALL provide clear error messages and rollback capabilities
5. WHEN infrastructure is destroyed THEN the system SHALL properly clean up all resources and data backups

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want InfluxDB access to be properly secured, so that time series data remains protected with appropriate authentication and encryption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database is accessed THEN the system SHALL require proper IAM authentication and authorization
2. WHEN data is transmitted THEN the system SHALL use TLS encryption for all client connections
3. WHEN data is stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt data at rest using AWS managed keys
4. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL log security events and block access
5. WHEN network access is configured THEN the system SHALL restrict connections to authorized VPC subnets only

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a monitoring specialist, I want comprehensive observability for the InfluxDB service, so that I can track performance, errors, and resource utilization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the service is running THEN CloudWatch SHALL collect metrics for query performance, write throughput, and storage usage
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL generate alerts for connection failures, query timeouts, and data ingestion issues
3. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL provide detailed metrics for troubleshooting and optimization
4. IF resource limits are approached THEN the system SHALL alert administrators before service impact occurs
5. WHEN costs are tracked THEN the system SHALL provide detailed billing information for InfluxDB usage

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to maintain compatibility with existing Knowledge Base queries, so that RAG functionality continues to work with time series insights.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Knowledge Base queries reference time series data THEN the system SHALL seamlessly query InfluxDB for relevant information
2. WHEN embeddings are generated THEN the system SHALL include time series context from InfluxDB query results
3. WHEN natural language questions about trends are asked THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate InfluxDB queries for analysis
4. IF time series queries are complex THEN the system SHALL break them down into manageable InfluxDB operations
5. WHEN responses are generated THEN the system SHALL cite specific time series data points and time ranges from InfluxDB
