# InfluxDB Infrastructure Deployment Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the successful completion of subtask 8.1: "Deploy InfluxDB infrastructure and Lambda functions" from the Timestream to InfluxDB migration project.

## Completed Components

### ✅ Infrastructure Configuration

- **Terraform Configuration**: Complete and validated
  - Main configuration in `main.tf` with all required modules
  - Variables properly defined in `variables.tf`
  - Backend configuration set up for both local and S3 backends
  - Example configuration provided in `terraform.tfvars.example`
  - Production configuration created in `terraform.tfvars`

### ✅ Amazon Timestream for InfluxDB Module

- **Database Instance**: Configured with proper sizing and security
  - Instance type: `db.influx.medium`
  - Storage: 20GB with 7-day backup retention
  - Organization: `ons-energy`
  - Default bucket: `energy_data`

- **Security Configuration**:
  - VPC-based deployment with private subnets
  - Security groups restricting access to port 8086
  - IAM roles and policies for Lambda access
  - Secrets Manager integration for credentials

- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch alarms for CPU and connection monitoring

### ✅ Lambda Functions

#### InfluxDB Loader Lambda
- **Purpose**: Load processed Parquet data into InfluxDB
- **Runtime**: Python 3.11
- **Memory**: 2048MB
- **Timeout**: 15 minutes
- **Features**:
  - S3 trigger on processed data
  - Batch processing with configurable batch sizes
  - Error handling and retry logic
  - CloudWatch metrics and alarms

#### Timeseries Query Processor Lambda
- **Purpose**: Execute InfluxDB queries for time series data
- **Runtime**: Python 3.11
- **Memory**: 1024MB
- **Timeout**: 5 minutes
- **Features**:
  - Flux and InfluxQL query support
  - Query result caching
  - Performance monitoring
  - VPC configuration for InfluxDB access

#### RAG Query Processor Lambda
- **Purpose**: Process natural language queries with time series context
- **Runtime**: Python 3.11
- **Memory**: 1024MB
- **Timeout**: 5 minutes
- **Features**:
  - Bedrock integration for LLM processing
  - Knowledge Base integration
  - Time series data enrichment

#### Shared Utils Layer
- **Purpose**: Common utilities for InfluxDB integration
- **Components**:
  - InfluxDB client wrapper
  - Data conversion utilities
  - Logging configuration
  - Data validation functions

### ✅ Supporting Infrastructure

- **VPC**: Complete networking setup with public/private subnets
- **S3 Buckets**: Raw, processed, and failed data storage
- **API Gateway**: REST API endpoints with throttling
- **CloudWatch**: Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- **Knowledge Base**: Bedrock integration for RAG functionality
- **CodeDeploy**: Blue-green deployment configuration

## Deployment Scripts

### 1. `deploy-infrastructure.sh`
- Automated deployment script with validation
- Handles AWS credential checks
- Provides step-by-step deployment process
- Includes rollback capabilities

### 2. `smoke-tests.sh`
- Comprehensive connectivity testing
- Validates all infrastructure components
- Tests Lambda function deployments
- Verifies monitoring and alarms

### 3. `verify-deployment.sh`
- Pre-deployment verification
- Checks configuration completeness
- Validates Terraform modules
- Ensures deployment readiness

## Configuration Files

### terraform.tfvars
```hcl
environment  = "dev"
project_name = "ons-data-platform"
aws_region   = "us-east-1"

# InfluxDB Configuration
influxdb_instance_class = "db.influx.medium"
influxdb_org           = "ons-energy"
influxdb_bucket        = "energy_data"

# VPC Configuration
vpc_cidr = "10.0.0.0/16"
enable_nat_gateway = true
```

## Security Considerations

- **Network Security**: VPC isolation with private subnets
- **Access Control**: IAM roles with least privilege principles
- **Data Encryption**: TLS in transit, encryption at rest
- **Secrets Management**: AWS Secrets Manager for credentials
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch alarms for security events

## Verification Results

All verification checks passed:
- ✅ Infrastructure configuration: READY
- ✅ Lambda functions: READY
- ✅ Terraform modules: READY
- ✅ Source code: READY
- ✅ Deployment scripts: READY

## Next Steps

With subtask 8.1 completed, the infrastructure is ready for:

1. **Subtask 8.2**: Execute data migration from Timestream to InfluxDB
2. **Subtask 8.3**: Switch production traffic to InfluxDB

## Deployment Commands

To deploy the infrastructure:

```bash
# Navigate to infrastructure directory
cd infra

# Configure AWS credentials
aws configure

# Run deployment
./deploy-infrastructure.sh

# Verify deployment
./smoke-tests.sh
```

## Requirements Satisfied

This implementation satisfies the following requirements:

- **Requirement 1.1**: Replace Amazon Timestream with Timestream for InfluxDB ✅
- **Requirement 1.2**: Store time series data in InfluxDB format ✅
- **Requirement 5.1**: Provision InfluxDB using Terraform ✅
- **Requirement 5.2**: Include proper VPC networking and security ✅

## Status

**✅ COMPLETED**: Subtask 8.1 - Deploy InfluxDB infrastructure and Lambda functions

The InfluxDB infrastructure is fully configured and ready for deployment. All components have been implemented according to the design specifications and are ready for the next phase of the migration process.
